# C8051F340 Microcontroller
This repository is for the development and programming of the C8051F340 Microcontroller by Silicon Labs. The F340 is a small yet powerful, general purpose microcontroller. It has peripherals like ADCs, UARTs, GPIO pins, Timers etc.

## Software
*  Download and install the Simplicity Studio Software by Silicon Labs
*  [Getting Started with Simplicity Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa0_xmd2qfc) - This video provides a good explaination of how to progress after installing Simplicity Studio. Install the C8051 packages.

## Guidelines
* The code should be written in Simplicity Studio, and tested on a C8051F340 microcontroller before upload.
* All uploaded projects must have an appropriate read-me file, describing their content elaborately.
* Programs should be written according to the MISRA C standard.
* Do not write complete programs in single C files. Make different C files for various function definitions and initializations.
* Create appropriate header files, and do not declare all global functions and variables in a single file (as you may not need to import all those in each of the C files).
